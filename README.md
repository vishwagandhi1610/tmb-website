# tmb-website

The project is a website built using the Django web framework, which showcases a menu of various ice cream flavors and products. The website incorporates frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create an appealing and user-friendly interface. The website allows users to browse through different ice cream flavors and view details such as descriptions, ingredients, and pricing.

One of the notable features of the website is the integration with a Dialogflow chatbot. Dialogflow is a natural language processing platform that enables the implementation of conversational interfaces. By integrating Dialogflow, the website incorporates a chatbot functionality, allowing users to engage in interactive conversations regarding ice cream flavors, ingredients, recommendations, or any other related inquiries.
